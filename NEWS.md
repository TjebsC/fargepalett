# fargepalett 0.0.3

* Updated theme to fit the standard PwC layout
* Added pwc_palette2 which is a reordered version of pwc_palette to increase contrast
* Added pwc_palette2_expanded that includes more colors with high(est) possible visual contrast between them
* Included the scale_color function that uses the given palette, given that there is enough colors, otherwise it constructs new ones

## TODOS:
* Add a style guide for PwC plots
* Add more palettes and descibe when they should be used, in line with guidelines from PwC
* Include or link to resources and gallery of plots for inspiration
* Figure out a good way to format tables (using GT or DT?)
* Include a PwC markdown theme (might be wise to rename package name if used)
* Document and use a single language for names/doc (English > Norwegian?)
